# M103_Project

Hello! This is the repository for our project in MATH 103, where we create a Python program for students to have hands-on experience on the following basic ciphers:
  - Caesar cipher
  - Affine cipher
  - Vigen√®re cipher

## Brief Overview of the ciphers

### Caesar cipher

Widely regarded as one of the most basic and historically significant ciphers, the Caesar cipher is a building block in classical cryptography. The key idea is that an encoded text is encrypted by having its characters "shifted" by a number of letters in the alphabet.

For example, let's say we have a text "abc". The person encrypting can shift the letters by 3, so that the text is encrypted as "def".
